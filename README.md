**DESCRIPTION**
Features:

Makes Up Sales Data: If you don't have real sales data, it can create some fake numbers for regions, product types, and months so you can see how the charts work.
Draws Bar Chart: Shows a clear bar for each region, making it easy to see which one has the highest sales.
Draws Donut Chart: Helps you quickly understand what percentage of your total sales comes from each product category.
Draws Line/Area Chart: Plots sales over each month, so you can spot trends (like sales going up in summer or down in winter).
Stylish Look: Uses dark colors for the background and bright purple for the charts, making it visually appealing.
Easy-to-Read Numbers: Automatically formats big sales numbers into "K" (thousands) or "M" (millions) so they're easier to read on the charts.
Static Picture: It creates a picture of these charts. You can't click on them or interact with them like a real online dashboard, but it's great for sharing in a presentation.
